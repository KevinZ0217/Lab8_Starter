1. The first one should be the right answer. We don't need to run the test manually if they are in the github action, and most bugs will be caught before the code are integrated into the repo. 
2. This is incorrect. We should use unit testing for single function, and use E2E testing to examine the performance of the entire application as opposed to a single function. 
3. This is incorrect. Sending a message involves multiple moving parts, because multiple users and features will be involved. Thus it's better to use UI testing. 
4. This is correct. Checking the max length of a message is a small and isolated feature, so it won't interact with other features. Thus, unit test works well.
